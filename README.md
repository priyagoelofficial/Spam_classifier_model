#### Spam_classifier_model
A spam classifier machine learning model is a specialized tool developed to automatically categorize incoming digital messages, such as emails or text messages, as either "spam" (unwanted or unsolicited content) or "ham" (legitimate and desired content). This type of model is widely used in email services and messaging platforms to filter out unwanted messages and improve user experience.
